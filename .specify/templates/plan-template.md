# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify this feature aligns with Notio Constitution v2.0.0 principles:

- [ ] **I. Pragmatic Testing Strategy**: 100% code coverage planned with 60-70% integration tests, 20-30% E2E tests, 10-20% unit tests (edge cases only)
- [ ] **II. Component Reusability**: Components designed with single responsibility, reusable across musical contexts, clearly documented props
- [ ] **III. Educational Pedagogy First**: Features support learner personas, progressive disclosure, immediate feedback, music theory alignment, accessibility
- [ ] **IV. Performance & Responsiveness**: Audio latency <50ms, notation rendering <200ms, 60fps animations, tested on target devices
- [ ] **V. Integration-First Testing**: Musical features tested together (notation+audio+interaction), critical journeys have E2E coverage
- [ ] **VI. Accessibility & Inclusive Design**: Full keyboard navigation, color not sole indicator, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, audio complements visual
- [ ] **VII. Simplicity & Maintainability**: Simplest solution implemented, abstractions justified, dependencies evaluated, complexity documented

**Violations requiring justification** (fill Complexity Tracking section if any):
- None expected - if violations exist, document in Complexity Tracking table below

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
