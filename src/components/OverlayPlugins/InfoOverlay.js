                            The coloured “xylophone” keys and the piano are playable both by clicking and by using the computer keyboard.<br/>
                            Only notes that are part of the scale can make a sound!<br/>
                            <br/>
                            On the computer keyboard:<br/>
                            To play the notes of the scale from the root, start with the keys FGHJ.<br/>
                            To add a bass line (in non-extended mode), the keys are, depending on your keyboard:<br/>
                            ZXC ASD QWE (QWERTY)<br/>
                            WXC QSD AZE (AZERTY)<br/>
                            YXC ASD QWE (QWERTZ)<br/>
                            The bass line can be moved to another octave using the arrow keys up and down.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            In extended mode, you can start playing in the octave below the root by using ASDF/QSDF and continue three notes into the next octave by using<br/>
                            ‘[=  (QWERTY)<br/>
                            ÄÅ´ (QWERTY Nordic)<br/>

                            ÄÜ´ (QWERTZ)<br/>
                            The bass line is disabled in extended mode. <br/>

                            You can make your own unique configurations and share them easily through the top menu.<br/>
                            The possible configurations are:<br/>
                            <b>Show keyboard</b>: Turn the piano on/off (the xylophone is still playable).<br/>
                            <b>Extended keyboard</b>: Extend to 2 octaves (this disables bass line).<br/>
                            <b>Sound</b>: Choose from a sound menu (more options coming!)<br/>
                            <b>Notation</b>: Show the names of the notes used in the scale in different languages and in the relative system. Show scale steps and extensions.<br/>
                            <b>Root</b>: Choose the root of the scale (DO). This will be the note that is played on the F of the computer keyboard and it will be displayed in red both on the xylophone and the piano keyboard.<br/>
                            <b>Scale</b>: Choose a scale or create your own!<br/>
                            <b>Clefs</b>: Choose the clef to be used, or disable the staff entirely.<br/>

                            When you have created a setup in Notio, you can save a link to it. Simply press the button "Share this setup", then press “Copy link”. You can share your link or a collection of copied links with anyone. For example, as a teacher, you can create a list of setups for your students to work through. Those who open the link will get an exact copy of your setup: all settings including the video URL will be included.

                            Encourage your students to explore the connections between sound, structure, and notation. Introduce elements of theory in a piece of music or as part of a course. Ask students to select music for listening and playing together, discuss what makes the music sound the way it sounds. Use Notio as support for songwriting sessions. Curate material for play-along, improvisation, and analysis<br/>

                            <b>The Notio project</b> focuses on researching and developing 
                            new pedagogies and technologies that support processes 
                            of learning to actively theorise and conceptualise music. 
                            We believe that having the possibility to explore and 
                            create music is central to those processes. With this in mind, 
                            we have designed the Notio digital environment as a flexible, 
                            open resource for teachers and learners.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            This browser-based application can be used together with music videos, 
                            tutorials, or backing tracks; to play along and improvise, 
                            and as support for writing, analysing and transcribing music. 
                            Notio also works well for ear training and for memorising scales 
                            and modes in different languages. By curating material that 
                            fits the learning goals and needs of groups and individual students, 
                            teachers can use the digital resource from beginner level to 
                            advanced professional level. Notio is public and free for anyone to use. 
                            For an optimal user experience, please open the application in Chrome 
                            on a laptop or desktop computer.<br/>

                          <Card.Text>
                            Yes! There are currently seven different setups that you can choose between by pressing the numbers 1–7 on your computer keyboard (see "How to"). We are currently working on an integrated colour picker that will allow you to customise the colour scheme. Please feel free to suggest a setup that you like!
